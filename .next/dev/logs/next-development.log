[00:00:01.034] Server  WARN     ⚠ The "middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-to-proxy
[00:00:01.038] Server  ERROR    ⨯ The file "./src/middleware.js" must export a function, either as a default export or as a named "middleware" export.
This function is what Next.js runs for every request handled by this middleware.

Why this happens:
- The file exists but doesn't export a function.
- The export is not a function (e.g., an object or constant).
- There's a syntax error preventing the export from being recognized.

To fix it:
- Ensure this file has either a default or "middleware" function export.
